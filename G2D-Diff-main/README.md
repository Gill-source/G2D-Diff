### Abstract
Despite advances in precision oncology, developing effective cancer therapeutics remains a significant challenge due to tumor heterogeneity and the limited availability of well-defined drug targets. Recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising opportunity to address this challenge by enabling the design of hit-like anti-cancer molecules conditioned on complex genomic features. We present Genotype-to-Drug Diffusion (G2D-Diff), a generative AI approach for creating small molecule-based drug structures tailored to specific cancer genotypes. G2D-Diff demonstrates exceptional performance in generating diverse, drug-like compounds that meet desired efficacy conditions for a given genotype. The model outperforms existing methods in diversity, feasibility, and condition fitness. G2D-Diff learns directly from drug response data distributions, ensuring reliable candidate generation without separate predictors. Its attention mechanism provides insights into potential cancer targets and pathways, enhancing interpretability. In triple-negative breast cancer case studies, G2D-Diff generated plausible hit-like candidates by focusing on relevant pathways. By combining realistic hit-like molecule generation with relevant pathway suggestions for specific genotypes, G2D-Diff represents a significant advance in AI-guided, personalized drug discovery. This approach has the potential to accelerate drug development for challenging cancers by streamlining hit identification.

# Environment setting (Linux (Ubuntu) and Anaconda)
- Create virtual environment 
> conda create -n g2d_diff python=3.8.10

- Activate environment
> conda activate g2d_diff
 
- Install required packages
> pip install -r requirement.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

The installation typically takes around 10 minutes, but the time may vary depending on the environment.

# Generation tutorial
- GenerationTutorial.ipynb
 
Generation with the trained condition encoder and diffusion model.  
It will take about 15 minutes for a single genotype input (ex. a cell line), but the time may vary depending on the environment.  

Check the comments in the notebook for further information about the source code.  
(ex. saving checkpoints. You may need to create a directory for saving.)

# Reproducing the models
Use the following jupyter notebooks after adding the kernel. 
> python -m ipykernel --user --name g2d_diff


For all .py file and jupyter notebooks for reproducing the models, check the comments for further information.  
(ex. saving checkpoints. You may need to create a directory for saving.)
